            <p>Hello! My friends call me Israel. I am a student at BYU-Idaho studying Web Design and Development. I am
                originally from Nigeria but have lived in Nigeria all my life. I love to travel, read,
                and play video games. I am excited to learn more about web development and design in this course!
                I hope to one day work as a web developer for a tech company. In addition to traveling, reading, and
                playing
                video games, I also enjoy listening to music, watching movies, playing soccer, spending time with
                friends
                and family, cooking, hiking, photography, and trying out new foods. I like learning new skills,
                exploring
                different cultures, and participating in community service activities.
                I am passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites that provide a great user experience.
