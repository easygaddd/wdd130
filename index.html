        <p>Hello! My friends call me Isreal. I am a student at BYU-Idaho studying Web Design and Development. I am
            originally from Nigeria but have lived in Nigeria all my life. I love to travel, read,
            and play video games. I am excited to learn more about web development and design in this course!
            I hope to one day work as a web developer for a tech company.
